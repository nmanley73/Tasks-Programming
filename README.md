# Tasks-Programming

This assignment concerns the numpy.random package of the numpy library in Python. The submission is made through a Jupyter notebook and is broken down into the following sub-sections.

#### 1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.
I use the random.rand and the random.choice function to explain the overall purpose of the numpy.random package.


#### 2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.
- random.integers and random.random functions were selected to explain the use of the simple random data functions.
- Permutation and shuffle functions are displayed to explain the concepts of the permutations functions.


#### 3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.
The following distribution functions were used to explain the use of Distribution function.
- Normal distribution
- Uniform distribution
- Logistic distribution
- Exponential distribution
- Geometric distribution

#### 4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.
The seeds functionality is decribed in section 4 and how it is used to generate pseudorandom numbers. Also the main differences between the Mersenne Twister (MIT) and Permuted Congruential generator (PCG64) is discussed. In particular what areas in which the new PCG64 algorithm outperforms the MIT version are analysed.
